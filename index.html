            <p> My main goal in life is to never stop learning. I'm a December 2017 graduate of the Univeristy of Texas at Austin with a B.A. in Latin Language and a minor in Chemistry with coursework spanning from molecular modeling on super computers to writing entire papers about a single Latin word. Now I'm aiming to create dynamic websites and fullstack apps to make the world more efficient. This profile is under constant construction, and I hope that you'll stick with me to watch it grow.

           <p>I love playing videogames, hanging out with my two cats, crocheting purses, and collecting plants. I'm using a combination of apps to try to learn Japanese, and my current goal with web development is to create a one-stop-shop for online language learning that combines rote memorization of vocabularly with an extensive grammar handbook.
